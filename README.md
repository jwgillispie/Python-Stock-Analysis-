"Bollinger Bands are envelopes plotted at a standard deviation level above and below a simple moving average of the price. Because the distance of the bands is based on standard deviation, they adjust to volatility swings in the underlying price." (Fidelity). 
This Jupyter Notebook is a stock screener that takes in a csv and gets stock data from the yfinance library to calculate and display bollinger bands.
Suggestions are made based on how close the current price is to either the lower or upper bollinger band, and a trading strategy is then suggested based on the calculation.
